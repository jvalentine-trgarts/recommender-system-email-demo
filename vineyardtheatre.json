[{"description":"Inspired by hospices, mystics and trips to the cemetery, Age is a Feeling wrestles with our endless chances to change course while we’re alive. A covert rallying cry against cynicism and regret. A call to seize our time. Written and performed by Haley McGee (The Ex-Boyfriend Yard Sale), this never-the-same-twice show is a gripping story about how our relationship with mortality shapes the way we live. \r\n\r\nAge is a Feeling premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe 2022, where it won the Fringe First Award, before transferring to the Soho Theatre in London for two sold-out runs.","htmlDescription":"<div id>\r\n\r\n</div>","duration":0,"imageUrl":"","isOnSale":false,"name":"AGE IS A FEELING","instanceDates":"September 11-October 20","thumbnailUrl":"","webEventId":null,"id":"12401ALRBGCBJJRJTTJKHBDCPJSGMKBSL","firstInstanceDateTime":"2024-09-11T19:00:00","lastInstanceDateTime":"2024-10-20T14:00:00","attribute_IsPresale":false,"attribute_PresaleMemberships":"","attribute_PresaleMemberships2":"","attribute_PresaleMemberships3":""},{"description":"Kelly K Klarkson and Quentavius da Quitter need to\r\nfind a name for their rap group.
